# Kidney Disease Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model aimed at detecting kidney diseases based on a dataset comprising over 24 features and more than 400 instances. The dataset is clean without any null values, and it underwent preprocessing to transform categorical data into numeric values using one-hot encoding. Other features were processed using suitable transformers to prepare them for training.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset was trained using K-Fold cross-validation, where various machine learning models were evaluated. Here are the results of the model evaluations:

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Achieved an accuracy of 97.01%.

2. **Random Forest:**
   - Demonstrated an accuracy of 98.51%.

3. **Support Vector Machine:**
   - Attained an accuracy of 97.01%.

4. **Decision Tree:**
   - Obtained an accuracy of 94.03%.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbours:**
   - Achieved an accuracy of 95.52%.
